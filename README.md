# MPINetworkCost
A piece of code I wrote for measuring the relatively network communication costs among MPI processes. To ensure the correctness of the measured costs, each MPI process should be bound to a core or a hwthread during its lifecycle. This can be achieved via mpirun --bind-to option. Also, the code require the installation of [hwloc](https://www.open-mpi.org/projects/hwloc/) libary. This is because I use the knowledge of the underlying hardware toplogy to speedup the measurement process.
